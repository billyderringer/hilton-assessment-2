### Hilton Assessment 2
Status: The application functions as specified. 
However, there are some key errors. There is 
also an input error that I am working on. 

Thoughts: This was my first exposure to styled
components, and I thought the separation of concerns
was a nice experience. The way that I built the local
storage seems to be a little bloated, so I will be looking
for better solutions to make the code more manageable.
